 This is a simple python script to scrape prodcuts displayed on jumia's website using the base url and making changes to the category for products you want to search for and as well as the page number. I noticed most of the categories have 50 pages. Although this can be modified to the number of pages available.I had the data saved to a csv file as well as tables in my database depending on the category(i.e i make correctionds to the part written create table by creating a new table depending on the category). i also make changes to the file path depending on the category too .This is open to use by anyone and everyone

Incorrect column names and that affected the data sent to the csv file. i also made some corrections to the code
